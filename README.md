## What it does
RecipeWhisper automatically extracts recipes from YouTube cooking videos by:

- 🎵 Audio Extraction - Downloads audio from YouTube videos using yt-dlp
- 🎤 Speech-to-Text - Converts audio to text using OpenAI's Whisper
- 🤖 Smart Parsing - Uses LLMs with Pydantic validation to structure recipes
- 📝 Clean Output - Generates properly formatted recipes with ingredients, steps, and timing

## Project Goals
This project is designed as a learning exercise to explore:

- Pydantic for data validation in LLM systems
- Multi-modal AI pipelines (audio → text → structured data)
- Real-world LLM applications beyond simple chat
- Robust error handling in AI workflows

## Why This Project?
