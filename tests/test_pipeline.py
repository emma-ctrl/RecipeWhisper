    Welcome back to my kitchen! Today I'm excited to show you how to make 
    the perfect banana bread. This recipe serves about 8 people and takes 
    about an hour total.
    
    For ingredients, you'll need 3 ripe bananas, 1 and a half cups of 
    all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of melted butter, 
    1 egg, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and a pinch of salt.
    
    Let's start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 
    While that's heating up, mash those bananas in a large bowl. 
    Next, mix in the melted butter with the mashed bananas. 
    Add the sugar, egg, and vanilla - mix well. 
    In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. 
    Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. 
    Pour the batter into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan. 
    Bake for 60 to 65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 
    Let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing.
